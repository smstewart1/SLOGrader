In my previous role we originally used an Excel file to handle processing student data, but the major issue with the Excel file was that the number of questions could not be varied without requiring massive changes to hidden sheets.  This python program is meant to replace the Excel file allowing it have to more functionality.  

For this version, it can be used with any iteration of the exam, but the next iteration is meant to incorporate a web insterface to allow users to select files instead of having to manually change the python file.
